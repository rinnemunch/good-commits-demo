# Clean Commits Demo

This repo is an example of how to properly write Git commit messages.

Every commit in this project follows best practices:
- Clear, structured messages like `feat: add button to landing page`
- Consistent formatting and context
- Small, logical changes per commit
- Easy-to-read, easy-to-track history

---

## 🛠️ What’s in the project?

A basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript page with:
- A heading
- A button
- Some minimal styles and scripts

Nothing complex — the goal is to show how even simple projects benefit from clean commit practices.

## ✅ Why Clean Commits Matter

Good commit hygiene makes it easier to:
- Track down bugs
- Understand the history of a feature
- Collaborate with a team
- Quickly revert or debug code if needed
